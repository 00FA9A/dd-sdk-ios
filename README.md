## Example Application

This repository contains example apps showing SDK features (see `examples/` folder). To send real logs, you must create `examples/examples-secret.xcconfig` file with your own client token obtained on Datadog website. The file must have following structure:

```xml
DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN=your-own-token-generated-on-datadog-website

```

You can also use `./tools/kickoff.sh` tool to have the file template generated for you. See more in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
